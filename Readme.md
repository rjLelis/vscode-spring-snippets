# VsCode snippets for Spring xml mapping

A collection of snippets for Spring xml mapping

## Usage

| snippets | content |
|----------|---------|
|`insert-spring` | maps the spring servlet on web.xml|
| `spring-xmls` | spring's xml schemas|
| `insert-view` | maps the path to spring to find the view |
| `insert-ioc` | inserts the dependency injection configuration|

Note: i know we don't use xml for spring configuration anymore, i just find it fun to make some snippets and put it out there :smile:
