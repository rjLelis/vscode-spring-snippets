# VsCode snippets for for Spring configuration

## XML mapping(for those whose still use it)

| snippets | content |
|----------|---------|
|`insert-spring` | maps the spring servlet on web.xml|
| `spring-xmls` | spring's xml schemas|
| `insert-view` | maps the path to spring to find the view |
| `insert-ioc` | inserts the dependency injection configuration|

## application.properties
| snippets | content |
| -------- | ------- |
| `jpa-config` | Sets up jpa in the spring project |

Note: i know we don't use xml for spring configuration anymore, i just find it fun to make some snippets and put it out there :smile:
